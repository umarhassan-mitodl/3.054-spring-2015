## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *3.054 Cellular Solids: Structure, Properties and Applications* as it was taught by Dr. Lorna Gibson in Spring 2014.

This course spotlights the structure and mechanical behavior of honeycombs and foams; students apply models for the behavior of cellular solids to applications in engineering and medicine and to natural materials.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Learn about the structure of cellular materials and to understand how that structure can be related to mechanical or thermal properties of the materials.
- Gain an appreciation of the broad range of cellular materials, and how similar principles can be applied to all of these materials.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Academic and industry careers, including biomedical engineering, orthopedics, osteoporosis, orthopedic materials, and materials for engineering applications.
